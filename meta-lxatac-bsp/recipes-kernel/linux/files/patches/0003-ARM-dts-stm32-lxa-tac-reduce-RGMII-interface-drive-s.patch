Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: stm32: lxa-tac: reduce RGMII interface drive
 strength
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This results in an improvement of EMI performance by reducing the
125MHz emission and its harmonics caused by the RGMII clock line.
